# Football Reinforcement Learning Agents

This repo consist of several reinforcement learning agent models trained to play football . All of these models were developed for kaggle competition [Google Research Football with Manchester City F.C.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-football) . Follow all the notebooks to experience the RL domain .Below are the RL architectures used : 

* Deep Q 
* Dueling Deep Q with prioritized Buffer
* Deep SARSA
* Actor - Critic
* Policy Gradient
* Monte Carlo



## Usage

```python
